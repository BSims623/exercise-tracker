# Exercise Tracker

This is a freeCodeCamp project where one builds an exercise tracker app. This app allows the user to create a username then submit exercises to a log. The log user info can then be accesses by sending a post request with user id in the params. The log can also be filtered by date and return the desired amount of exercise post with a limit option by sending a post with user id in params and filter options in a query string.
